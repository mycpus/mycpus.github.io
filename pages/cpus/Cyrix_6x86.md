## 关于 Cyrix 6x86

Cyrix 6x86 处理器属于第五代 x86 处理器，于 1996 年 2 月上市。这些超标量和超流水线微处理器与 Intel Pentium 引脚兼容，因此可以在 Socket 5 和 Socket 7 主板上运行，这在当时很常见。由于时钟频率相同的 6x86 比 Intel Pentium 处理器的整数性能明显优越，因此应用了所谓的 P 等级，就像 5x86 的情况一样。例如，具有 110 MHz 处理器时钟的 6x86 P133+ 与具有 133 MHz 的 Intel Pentium 一样快。

关键数据：
 - 3,000,000 个晶体管
 - 0.65 µm CMOS 制造技术
 - 超流水线、超标量架构（每个时钟可同时执行 2 条指令）
 - 64 位数据总线
 - 32 位地址总线
 - MMU（内存管理单元）
 - 16 KB + 256 字节 L1 缓存
 - 支持到 4 GB 的内存
 - 使用 P 等级（相对于 Intel Pentium 的性能）

## Introduction

Cyrix entered the fifth generation processor market with the 6x86 processor, formerly projected as the M1. As a successful and cheaper (often less than half the cost) alternative to the Intel Pentium, it is pin- and voltage-compatible with it. Cyrix gave it the 6x86 name in reference to some of its more advanced features, which it calls "sixth generation". In reality, the processor is comparable in power and architecture to the fifth-generation Pentium.
 
The 6x86 is not a Pentium clone. Clones are exact or near-exact copies, usually being reversed engineered or based on licensed code. The 6x86 is based on an original Cyrix design. It incorporates several advanced architectural features that allow it to outperform a Pentium of equal clock speed. For this reason Cyrix helped invent the "P-Rating" system. This was an advantage to help people make a valid comparism but also caused some confusion when setting the appropriate clock speed on the motherboard.
 
The Cyrix 6x86 range has the most powerful processor core of any x86 processor of its generation. Unfortunately, like the AMD K5, it also has a very slow floating point math capability and so was a very poor games and 3D performer.
 
The processor is designed for Socket 7 and is available in several clock speeds, some of them rather unusual. The 6x86 PR200 (150 Mhz) processor introduced non-standard bus speeds up to 75 MHz - many motherboards and PCI cards did not support this speeds: Since the PCI bus runs at half of the mainboard bus speed, you are increasing the PCI bus to 37.5 MHz with a bus speed of 75 MHz. Several PCI cards, especially some graphics cards, did not run correctly with this overclocked bus.
