## FPU for 386DX CPU

The CX-83D87 was introduced in 1989. It is the fastest 387-compatible coprocessor and provides up to 50% more performance than the Intel 387DX. The 83D87 also offers the most accurate transcendental functions of all coprocessors. It is the 387 clone with the highest degree of compatibility to the Intel 387DX. Unlike the Intel 387DX, the 83D87 (and all other 387-compatible chips as well) does not support asynchronous operation of CPU and coprocessor. To reduce power consumption the 83D87 features advanced power saving features. Those portions of the coprocessor that are not needed are automatically shut down. If no coprocessor instructions are being executed, all parts except the bus interface unit are shut down.
