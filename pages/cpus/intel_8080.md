## 中文介绍

Intel 8080为8008的加强版中央处理器晶片（CPU），其运算速度达到2 Mhz，有直接记忆体定址、支援超过七层堆叠、并支援到64KB的记忆体的特点。 8080被用于当时一种品牌为Altair（牵牛星，这个名字来源于当时电视剧「星际奇航」的企业号太空船的最终目的地）的电脑上。这也是有史以来第一个知名的个人电脑。当时这种电脑的套件售价是395美元，短短数月的时间里面，销售业绩达到了数万部，创造了个人电脑销售历史的一个里程碑。比尔‧盖兹（Bill Gates）当初就是在杂志上看到使用Intel 8080当中央处理器晶片（CPU）的Altair 8080电脑才决定来帮这款电脑设计BASIC程式语言，当然后来的微软霸业也就是从这台电脑开始的。 Intel C8080A为Intel C8080的改良版。右边这颗紫色陶瓷C8080A为同型号里面最稀有的版本，全世界目前已知只有五颗（都是同一批）。这款紫色陶瓷C8080A的生产日期比一般的白色陶瓷C8080A要晚很多，而且比后来推出的C8080B还要晚，应该是英特尔陶瓷版8080最后一批产品（说不定是因为白色陶瓷封装用完了？）。 P8080A为8008的量产版。实际上，由于这款处理器的成功，很多厂商也投入生产这款处理器，包括日本、俄罗斯、匈牙利、罗马尼亚以及波兰都有生产这款微处理器。

## 英文介绍

The Intel 8080 is an early 8-bit CPU, released in April 1974 running at 2 MHz, and is generally considered to be the first truly usable microprocessor CPU design. It is the successor to the Intel 8008, with which it was assembly language source-compatible because it used the same instruction set developed by Computer Terminal Corporation. The 8080's 40 pin DIP packaging permitted it to provide a 16-bit address bus and an 8-bit data bus, allowing access to 64 kilobytes of memory. It has seven 8-bit registers (six of which could be combined into three 16-bit registers), a 16-bit stack pointer to memory (replacing the 8008's internal stack), and a 16-bit program counter.
 
The 8080 had 256 I/O ports allowing I/O devices to be connected without the need to allocate memory space - as is required for memory mapped devices - but at the expense of having programmers deal with separate I/O instructions. The first single-board microcomputer was built on the basis of the 8080.
 
The 8080 was used in many early computers, such as the MITS Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080, forming the basis for machines running the CP/M operating system (the later, fully compatible and more capable, Zilog Z80 processor would capitalize on this, with Z80 & CP/M becoming the dominant CPU & OS combination of the period much like x86 & MS-DOS for the PC a decade later). Shortly after the launch of the 8080, the Motorola 6800 competing design was introduced, and after that, the MOS Technology 6502 clone of the 6800.
 
At Intel, the 8080 was followed by the compatible and electrically more elegant 8085, and later by the assembly language compatible 16-bit 8086 and then the 8/16-bit 8088, which was selected by IBM for its new PC to be launched in 1981. The 8080, via its ISA, thus got a lasting impact on computer history.
 
The 8080 was very popular and was second-sourced by various manufacturers. Clones of the 8080 were also made in former Eastern Bloc countries like USSR, Poland, CSSR, Hungary and Romania.
 
Versions and speed:
8080/8080A: 2.0 MHz
8080A-1: 3.125 MHz
8080A-2: 2.67 MHz
