summary: "奔腾4(Pentium 4，或简称奔4或P4)是英特尔公司于2000年11月发布的第7代x86微处理器。并且是继1995年出品的Pentium Pro之后的第一款重新设计过的处理器，这一新的架构称做NetBurst。首款产品代码为:Willamette，拥有1.4GHz左右的内核时钟，并使用Socket 423脚位架构，首款处理器于2000年11月发布。不同于Pentium II、Pentium III和各种Celeron处理器，因为是全新设计的产品，所以与Pentium Pro的关联很小。值得注意的是，Pentium 4有着非常快速到400MHz的前端总线，之后更有提升到533MHz、800MHz。它其实是一个为100MHz的四条并列总线(100Mhz x4 并列)，因此理论上它可以传送比一般总线多四倍的容量，所以号称有400MHz的速度。AMD Athlon的前端总线则有266MHz的速度(133MHz双倍并列总线)。"

## 关于 Intel Pentium 4

## Introduction

Intel Pentium 4 is a family of high-performance microprocessors that succeeded Pentium III family. Pentium 4 CPUs are based on new NetBurst micro-architecture, which differed significantly from P6 micro-architecture used in Pentium II/Pentium III microprocessors. As an overall CPU performance is proportional to its frequency and its efficiency, to achieve better performance levels many micro-architectures, including P6, strike a delicate balance between faster CPU frequencies and improved efficiency. The NetBurst microarchitecture used different approach - it attempted to improve performance primarily by increasing CPU frequency, often at at the expense of efficiency. One of key elements in this approach was "Hyper-Pipelined Technology" - 20-stage pipeline (not counting decoder stages), that was significantly longer than in previous generation of Pentium processors. While longer pipelines are less efficient than shorter ones, they allow CPU core to reach higher frequencies, and thus increase CPU performance. To improve efficiency of very deep pipeline the Pentium 4 processors included new features: Trace Execution Cache, Enhanced Branch prediction, and Quad Data Rate bus. Intel Pentium 4 CPUs also included 144 new SIMD instructions called SSE2. Because the first generation of Pentium 4 processors, based on Willamette core, proved to be performing not significantly faster, and sometimes slower than the fastest Pentium III microprocessors, Intel added more efficiency improvements to subsequent Pentium 4 core generations - larger size of level 2 cache, faster FSB frequency, SSE3 instruction set, and Hyper-Threading technology. Other features, that were eventually added to the family, are 64-bit instruction set, and Virtualization technology.
First Pentium 4 microprocessors, based on Willamette and Northwood cores, as well as some Prescott processors, were referenced by their speed. To differentiate between Pentium 4 CPUs running at the same frequency, but having different features, Intel used one letter suffix, appended to CPU frequency:
* A - Northwood microprocessors with 512 KB L2 cache (for frequencies 2 GHz and lower), or Prescott CPUs with 1 MB L2 cache (for frequencies higher than 2 GHz).
* B - processors with 533 MHz FSB frequency.
* C - processors featuring Hyper-Threading technology and 800 MHz FSB.
* E - Prescott CPUs with 1 MB L2 cache.

Later generations of Pentium 4 CPUs, starting from Prescott core, were assigned processor numbers that uniquely identified processor frequency and features. Please see Intel desktop processor numbers page for more information.

"Pentium 4" brand was used only for high-performance single-core desktop and mobile microprocessors. Server-class CPUs, that were built on NetBurst microarchitecture, were branded Xeon and Xeon MP. Low-cost NeBurst microprocessors were manufactured under "Celeron" brand. Dual-core NetBurst-based microprocessors were branded Pentium D.

All Pentium 4s were manufactured in three types of packages - 423-pin PGA package for socket 423 motherboards, 478-pin micro-PGA package that worked in socket 478 motherboards, and pin-less 775-land LGA package that required socket 775 motherboards. Socket 478 package was used by both desktop and mobile microprocessors, while two other packages were designed for desktop systems only.
